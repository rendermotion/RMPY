Architecture

The architecture behind RMPY is to have all the tools at your hand to create rigs.
Currently some scripts have found its place and others don't,


The main pieces of the architecture are the name convention, the creators, the system structure, the rig structure.
you can learn more about them in the following links.
Many tools that didn't fell under this categories are written under core, most of this tools are used during the build of the rig rather than in the rigs.
Including all the configuration of the rig builds which are found on the
